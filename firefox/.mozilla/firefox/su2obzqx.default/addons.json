Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.\n\nCompatibility: This add-on has been thoroughly tested with the latest versions of Firefox. If the OneTab tab fails to load, this could also be because you have another third party add-on which is conflicting with OneTab. In particular, there are some third party add-ons that block javascript from loading, or that customize the right click menu options and prevent the OneTab right click menu from appearing.\n\nIMPORTANT JUNE 2016 UPDATE:\nWe've just released a new version of OneTab with a completely rewritten storage engine. This is designed to fix the long standing bug, where under certain circumstances such as a browser crash or a lack of disk space, Firefox sometimes wiped clean the JSON storage which contained your tabs. Now we're using IndexedDB which is designed to be vastly superior and which has safeguards for data resilience. Please note that if you were previously manually backing up your tabs by copying the 'json' storage file, this will no longer reflect the current state of your tabs, so instead we recommend you use the 'Export' mechanism built into the OneTab addon or alternatively ensure you have online or other backup which will back up your Firefox profile directory.\n\nIMPORTANT: Firefox 'Refresh' will remove all of your add-ons\nSometimes, Firefox will display a message in your browser asking if you'd like to \"Refresh Firefox\". This sounds like it's a normal Firefox update, but it is not. It warns you that it will delete all of the addons in your browser, but most people click so fast through the Firefox warnings that they don't realise how dangerous this feature is. Therefore please do not use the 'Refresh Firefox' feature if you want to keep your list of saved OneTab tabs!

Help bring vimperator into the age of e10s and WebExtensions!\n\nVimperator is a free browser add-on for Firefox, which makes it look and behave like the Vim text editor. It has similar key bindings and you could call it a modal web browser, as key bindings differ according to which mode you are in. For example, it has a special Hint mode, where you can follow links easily with the keyboard only. Also most functionality is available as commands, typing :back will go back within the current page history, just like hitting the back button in the toolbar.\n\nBut Vimperator is more than just a simple command interface to Firefox — it is a complete development environment as well. If you are a web developer, you can enjoy an interactive JavaScript shell — even with completion support. Or if you want to extend Vimperator, you can easily do that by just dropping a JavaScript file in its plugin directory.\n\nVimperator was initially written by Martin Stubenschrott but has found many other contributors in the meanwhile.\n\nIf there are any issues, please check out our issue tracker https://github.com/vimperator/vimperator-labs/issues and add the issue if it isn't already recorded.\n\n=== Features ===\n\n* Vim-like keybindings (h, j, k, l, gg, G, 0, $, ZZ, , etc.)\n* Ex commands (:quit, :open www.foo.com, ...)\n* Tab completion available for all commands with support for 'longest' matching when set in 'wildmode'\n* Extensions! Yes, you can extend Vimperator's functionality with scripts just like you can extend Firefox with extensions.\n* Explore JavaScript objects with :echo window and even context-sensitive tab completion.\n* Hit-a-hint like navigation of links (start with f to follow a link)\n* Advanced completion of bookmark and history URLs (searching also in title, not only URL)\n* Vim-like statusline with a wget-like progress bar\n* Minimal GUI (easily hide useless menubar and toolbar with :set guioptions=)\n* Ability to :source JavaScript files, and to use a ~/.vimperatorrc file\n* Easy quick searches (:open foo will search for \"foo\" in google, :open ebay terminator will search for \"terminator\" on ebay) with support for Firefox keyword bookmarks and search engines\n* Count supported for many commands (3 will go back 3 pages)\n* Beep on errors\n* Marks support (ma to set mark 'a' on a webpage, 'a to go there)\n* QuickMarks support (quickly go to previously marked web pages with go{a-zA-Z0-9})\n* :map and :command support (and feedkeys() for script writers)\n* :time support for profiling\n* Move the text cursor and select text with vim keys and a visual mode.\n* External editor support\n* Macros to replay key strokes\n* AutoCommands to execute action on certain events\n* A comprehensive :help, explaining all commands, mappings and options.\n* Much more...","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58919.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Hints allow to follow links with the keyboard"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58920.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Vimperator's completion system"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","width":"568","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/58/58921.png?src=api&modified=1307285716","thumbnailWidth":"162","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Exploring the DOM of the web page"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.vimperator.org/","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/582324/vimperator-3.16.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":465385,"contributionURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/developers?src=api","contributionAmount":"$10.00","developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimperator/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":227,"totalDownloads":860233,"weeklyDownloads":1275,"dailyUsers":27163,"updateDate":1487370928000,"supportURL":"http://www.vimperator.org"},{"id":"jid1-xUfzOsOFlzSOXg@jetpack","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/387/387429-32.png?modified=1487478020","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/387/387429-64.png?modified=1487478020"},"name":"Reddit Enhancement Suite","type":"extension","version":"5.4.3","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"honestbleeps","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/honestbleeps/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Andy Tuba","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/andytuba/?src=api"}],"description":"NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nRES is a suite of tools to enhance your reddit browsing experience.","fullDescription":"NOTE: Reddit Enhancement Suite is developed independently, and is not officially endorsed by or affiliated with reddit.\n\nReddit Enhancement Suite is a suite of tools to enhance your Reddit browsing experience.
